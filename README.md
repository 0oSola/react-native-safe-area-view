# react-native-safe-area-view

This is a JS-only version of SafeAreaView that will be available in React Native v0.50.0, to be released at the beginning of November. This version also adds a small api that makes SafeAreaView more flexible for complex UIs. React Navigation already includes and uses this view starting in (v1.0.0-beta.16)[https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.16].
